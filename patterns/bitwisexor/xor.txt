Important properties of XOR to remember #
Following are some important properties of XOR to remember:

Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0, e.g.,

1 ^ 1 = 0
29 ^ 29 = 0
Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number, e.g.,

1 ^ 0 = 1
31 ^ 0 = 31
XOR is Associative & Commutative, which means:

if the two numbers are the different 
3 ^ 2  -> Gets the difference 1 
2 ^ 3 -> Gets the sum -> 5 
2 ^ 3 ^ 3 -> 2 ( 2 + 3 = 5 - 3 = 2 )

(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)
a ^ b = b ^ a
In the following chapters, we will apply the XOR pattern to solve some interesting problems.

XOR can help prevent Integer over flow errors.
