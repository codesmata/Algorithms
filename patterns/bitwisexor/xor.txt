Important properties of XOR to remember #
Following are some important properties of XOR to remember:

Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0, e.g.,

1 ^ 1 = 0
29 ^ 29 = 0
Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number, e.g.,

1 ^ 0 = 1
31 ^ 0 = 31
XOR is Associative & Commutative, which means:

(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)
a ^ b = b ^ a
In the following chapters, we will apply the XOR pattern to solve some interesting problems.

XOR of a number with its complement returns all the bits set to 1. 
Similarly, XOR number with another number having all of it bit set gives the number complement 
number ^ all_bits_set = complement
number ^ complement = all_bits_set 
number ^ number = 0 
0 ^ number = number 

XOR a bit with 1 gives its complement 0 ^ 1 -> 1, 1 ^ 1 -> 0 

XOR can help prevent Integer over flow errors. 

Finding the rightmost set bit  of  number using ~ 
E.g. 
6  & ~(6 - 1)
Gien number is 6 -> 110 
Subtracted is 5 -> 101 
~5 -> 010 
110 & 010 -> 010 
Right most set bit = 10  
E.g. 2 
12 & ~(2 - 1) 
12 -> 1011
~ 11 -> 0100
12 & ~11  -> 0100
